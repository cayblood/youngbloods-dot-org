        <p data-aid="136805963" id="p1">One of the most common images in Western and Eastern religions alike is of God
            as a parent and of human beings as God's children. Billions pray to God as their parent, invoke the
            brotherhood and sisterhood of all people to promote peace, and reach out to the weary and troubled out of
            deep conviction that each of God's children has great worth.</p>
        <p data-aid="136805964" id="p2">But people of different faiths understand the parent-child relationship between
            God and humans in significantly different ways. Some understand the phrase "child of God" as an honorary
            title reserved only for those who believe in God and accept His guidance as they might accept a father's.
            Many see parent-child descriptions of God's relationship to humanity as metaphors to express His love for
            His creations and their dependence on His sustenance and protection.</p>
        <p data-aid="136805965" id="p3">Latter-day Saints see all people as children of God in a full and complete
            sense; they consider every person divine in origin, nature, and potential. Each has an eternal core and is
            "a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents."<a class="note-ref"
                                                                      href="#note1"><sup
                    class="marker">1</sup></a> Each possesses seeds of divinity and must choose whether to live in
            harmony or tension with that divinity. Through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, all people may "progress
            toward perfection and ultimately realize their divine destiny."<a class="note-ref"
                                                                              href="#note2"><sup
                    class="marker">2</sup></a> Just as a child can develop the attributes of his or her parents over
            time, the divine nature that humans inherit can be developed to become like their Heavenly Father's.</p>
        <p data-aid="136805966" id="p4">The desire to nurture the divinity in His children is one of God's attributes
            that most inspires, motivates, and humbles members of the Church. God's loving parentage and guidance can
            help each willing, obedient child of God receive of His fulness and of His glory. This knowledge transforms
            the way Latter-day Saints see their fellow human beings. The teaching that men and women have the potential
            to be exalted to a state of godliness clearly expands beyond what is understood by most contemporary
            Christian churches and expresses for the Latter-day Saints a yearning rooted in the Bible to live as God
            lives, to love as He loves, and to prepare for all that our loving Father in Heaven wishes for His
            children.</p>

            </header>
            <p data-aid="136805968" id="p5">Several biblical passages intimate that humans can become like God. The
                likeness of humans to God is emphasized in the first chapter of Genesis: "God said, Let us make man in
                our image, after our likeness. &hellip; So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created
                he him; male and female created he them."<a class="note-ref"

                of good and evil," God said they had "become as one of us,"<a class="note-ref"

                underway. Later in the Old Testament, a passage in the book of Psalms declares, "I have said, Ye are
                gods; and all of you are children of the most High."<a class="note-ref"
                                                                       href="#note5"><sup

            <p data-aid="136805969" id="p6">New Testament passages also point to this doctrine. When Jesus was accused
                of blasphemy on the grounds that "thou, being a man, makest thyself God," He responded, echoing Psalms,
                "Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?"<a class="note-ref"

            <p data-aid="136805970" id="p7">These passages can be interpreted in different ways. Yet by viewing them
                through the clarifying lens of revelations received by Joseph Smith, Latter-day Saints see these
                scriptures as straightforward expressions of humanity's divine nature and potential. Many other
                Christians read the same passages far more metaphorically because they experience the Bible through the
                lens of doctrinal interpretations that developed over time after the period described in the New

                divine. One modern scholar refers to the "ubiquity of the doctrine of deification"&mdash;the teaching
                that humans could become God&mdash;in the first centuries after Christ's death.<a class="note-ref"

                in the late Roman period and were infrequent by the medieval era. The first known objection by a church
                father to teaching deification came in the fifth century.<a class="note-ref"
                                                                            href="#note16"><sup

                limited in scope, as in the definition provided by Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite (ca. A.D. 500):
                "Deification &hellip; is the attaining of likeness to God and union with him <em>so far as is

            <p data-aid="136805974" id="p10">Why did these beliefs fade from prominence? Changing perspectives on the
                creation of the world may have contributed to the gradual shift toward more limited views of human
                potential. The earliest Jewish and Christian commentaries on the Creation assumed that God had organized
                the world out of preexisting materials, emphasizing the goodness of God in shaping such a
                life-sustaining order.<a class="note-ref"

                led to the development of a doctrine that God created the universe <i>ex nihilo&mdash;</i>"out of
                nothing." This ultimately became the dominant teaching about the Creation within the Christian world.<a

            <p data-aid="136805975" id="p11">Creation ex nihilo widened the perceived gulf between God and humans. It

                be." God is the Father of each human spirit, and because only "spirit and element, inseparably
                connected, receive a fulness of joy," He presented a plan for human beings to receive physical bodies
                and progress through their mortal experience toward a fulness of joy. Earthly birth, then, is not the

                exaltation with eternal marriage, the Lord declared that those who keep covenants, including the
                covenant of eternal marriage, will inherit "all heights and depths." "Then," says the revelation, "shall

                enlargement." Joseph Smith preached that long before the world was formed, God found "himself in the

                humans can progress to exaltation and godliness has been taught within the Church. Lorenzo Snow, the
                Church's fifth President, coined a well-known couplet: "As man now is, God once was: As God now is, man

                told a reporter in 1997, "That gets into some pretty deep theology that we don't know very much about."
                When asked about the belief in humans' divine potential, President Hinckley responded, "Well, as God is,
                man may become. We believe in eternal progression. Very strongly."<a class="note-ref"

            <p data-aid="136805988" id="p22">Eliza&nbsp;R. Snow, a Church leader and poet, rejoiced over the doctrine
                that we are, in a full and absolute sense, children of God. "I had learned to call thee Father, / Thru
                thy Spirit from on high," she wrote, "But, until the key of knowledge / Was restored, I knew not why."
                Latter-day Saints have also been moved by the knowledge that their divine parentage includes a Heavenly
                Mother as well as a Heavenly Father. Expressing that truth, Eliza&nbsp;R. Snow asked, "In the heav'ns
                are parents single?" and answered with a resounding <em>no:</em> "Truth eternal / Tells me I've a mother

                Saint young women recite their theme, each affirms, "I am a beloved daughter of heavenly parents, with a
                divine nature and eternal destiny." Teaching on human beings' divine parentage, nature, and potential
                features prominently in "The Family: A Proclamation to the World." Divine nature and exaltation are

            <p data-aid="136805991" id="p24">For some observers, the doctrine that humans should strive for godliness
                may evoke images of ancient pantheons with competing deities. Such images are incompatible with
                Latter-day Saint doctrine. Latter-day Saints believe that God's children will always worship Him. Our
                progression will never change His identity as our Father and our God. Indeed, our exalted, eternal
                relationship with Him will be part of the "fulness of joy" He desires for us.</p>
            <p data-aid="136805992" id="p25">Latter-day Saints also believe strongly in the fundamental unity of the
                divine. They believe that God the Father, Jesus Christ the Son, and the Holy Ghost, though distinct
                beings, are unified in purpose and doctrine.<a class="note-ref"

            <p data-aid="136805995" id="p27">Since human conceptions of reality are necessarily limited in mortality,
                religions struggle to adequately articulate their visions of eternal glory. As the Apostle Paul wrote,
                "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath
                prepared for them that love him."<a class="note-ref"
                                                    href="#note50"><sup
                        class="marker">50</sup></a> These limitations make it easy for images of salvation to become
                cartoonish when represented in popular culture. For example, scriptural expressions of the deep peace
                and overwhelming joy of salvation are often reproduced in the well-known image of humans sitting on
                their own clouds and playing harps after death. Latter-day Saints' doctrine of exaltation is often
                similarly reduced in media to a cartoonish image of people receiving their own planets.</p>
            <p data-aid="136805996" id="p28">A cloud and harp are hardly a satisfying image for eternal joy, although
                most Christians would agree that inspired music can be a tiny foretaste of the joy of eternal salvation.
                Likewise, while few Latter-day Saints would identify with caricatures of having their own planet, most
                would agree that the awe inspired by creation hints at our creative potential in the eternities.</p>
            <p data-aid="136805997" id="p29">Latter-day Saints tend to imagine exaltation through the lens of the sacred
                in mortal experience. They see the seeds of godhood in the joy of bearing and nurturing children and the
                intense love they feel for those children, in the impulse to reach out in compassionate service to
                others, in the moments they are caught off guard by the beauty and order of the universe, in the
                grounding feeling of making and keeping divine covenants. Church members imagine exaltation less through
                images of what they will <em>get</em> and more through the relationships they have now and how those
                relationships might be purified and elevated. As the scriptures teach, "That same sociality which exists
                among us here will exist among us there, only it will be coupled with eternal glory, which glory we do
                not now enjoy."<a class="note-ref"

            <p data-aid="136805999" id="p30">The teaching that human beings have a divine nature and future shapes the
                way Latter-day Saints view fundamental doctrine. Perhaps most significantly, belief in divine nature
                helps us more deeply appreciate the Atonement of Jesus Christ. While many Christian theologians have
                expressed the magnitude of the Savior's Atonement by emphasizing human depravity, Latter-day Saints
                understand the magnitude of the Atonement of Christ in terms of the vast human potential it makes
                possible. Christ's Atonement not only provides forgiveness from sin and victory over death, it also
                redeems imperfect relationships, heals the spiritual wounds that stifle growth, and strengthens and
                enables individuals to develop the attributes of Christ.<a class="note-ref"

                        class="marker">52</sup></a> Latter-day Saints believe that it is only through the Atonement of
                Jesus Christ that we can have a sure hope of eternal glory and that the power of His Atonement is fully
                accessed only by faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and
                enduring to the end in following the instruction and example of Christ.<a class="note-ref"
                                                                                          href="#note53"><sup
                        class="marker">53</sup></a> Thus, those who become like God and enter into a fulness of His
                glory are described as people who have been "made perfect through Jesus the mediator of the new
                covenant, who wrought out this perfect atonement through the shedding of his own blood."<a

            <p data-aid="136806000" id="p31">An awareness of humans' divine potential also influences Latter-day Saints'
                understanding of gospel principles such as the importance of divine commandments, the role of temples,
                and the sanctity of individual moral agency. Belief that human beings are actually God's children also
                changes Latter-day Saints' behavior and attitudes. For example, even in societies where casual and
                premarital sex are considered acceptable, Latter-day Saints retain a deep reverence for the God-given
                procreative and bonding powers of human sexual intimacy and remain committed to a higher standard in the
                use of those sacred powers. Studies suggest that Latter-day Saints place an exceptionally high priority
                on marriage and parenthood,<a class="note-ref"

            represents Joseph Smith's most detailed known discussion of divine nature and exaltation, it is important to
            note that because of the wind on the day the sermon was delivered and the limitations of transcription
            techniques, we are left without certainty about Joseph Smith's exact or complete wording during the sermon.
            The partial accounts of four witnesses and an early published account give us a record, if only an imperfect
            one, of what Joseph Smith taught on the occasion, and what he taught gives us insight into the meaning of
            numerous passages of scripture. But the surviving sermon text is not canonized and should not be treated as
            a doctrinal standard in and of itself. For the accounts of Willard Richards, William Clayton, Thomas
